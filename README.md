## Background
I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

##  Instructions
1. Use D3 library to read in JSON dataset from a URL.
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
4. Display the sample metadata, in the Demographic Info box.
5. Update all the plots and Demographic Info box when a new sample is selected. 
6. Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. 

**Bonus:**  Create a Gauge Chart based on Belly Button Washing Frequency



## Final Result
The dashboard for the *Belly Button Biodiversity* dataset can be found in the [Live Demo](https://bytravis.github.io/Module14_Belly-Button-Challenge/)
